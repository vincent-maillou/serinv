SDR pack several selected decompositions routines and linear system solvers for severals types of structured block-sparse matrices.

## Decompositions routines
### Block cholesky factorization
A block cholesky factorization routines for symmetric, positive-definite matrices.
### Block LU factorization
A block LU factorization routines for general, non-singular, matrices.

## Supported structured block-sparse matrices
### Block tridiagonal sparsity patterns

Such matrices presente a block tridiagonal sparsity pattern that can be associated with an arrowhead. In the case of an arrowhead matrix the sizes of the blocks of
the last column/last row can be differents.

### Block n-diagonals sparsity patterns

Such matrices presente a block n-diagonals sparsity pattern that can be associated with an arrowhead. In the case of an arrowhead matrix the sizes of the blocks of
the last column/last row can be differents.
